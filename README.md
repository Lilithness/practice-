this program contains simple functions that can read your Beta Hemoglobin Dna sequence from a file, then do the transcription to turn it into RNA, and reverse transcription also, to get the cDNA. it considers all the possible reading frames and translates them into Amino Acid chains that are stored in a list, compares every single one of them to the reference Amino Acid sequence that has been already given, and tells the user if this sequence is for a person who has Sickle celll animia or not.
